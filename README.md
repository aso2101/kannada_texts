The `raw` folder contains the **raw** data from either OCR or double-keyboarding in Kannada script.

The `tei` folder contains the **structured** and **transliterated** data in TEI format, based on the raw data. These files are the basis for all of the other transformations (plain text, etc.) you will see.

The `txt` folder contains plain text files that are **automatically generated** from the corresponding TEI files using the scripts in the `scripts` folder. They are not to be edited directly.

The `scripts` folder contains python and XSLT scripts used for either restructuring the raw data or for converting the TEI data into downstream formats (such as plain text).

The TEI files are validated against the `tei_all.rnc` schema in the `schemas` folder.
